# Next.js

This is a simple Next.js application which can be used to qury the last date & time a specific user made a post or a comment.


Instructions

Launch your terminal and navigate to "~/my-app" directory.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To stop an "npm run dev" process, simply press Ctrl + C in your terminal window; this sends an interrupt signal to the running process, effectively stopping it.
